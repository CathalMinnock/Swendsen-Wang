# Swendsen-Wang
Submitting swscript.sh to lonsdale should run the Swendsen-Wang algorithm, then use jackknife to get errors, then get autocorrelations

main.c runs the Swendsen-Wang algorithm, taking magnetization measurements. It uses grid.c and grid.h.

jackknife.sh and jackknife.py are used to get the errorbars

autocorrelation.sh and autocorrelation.py are used to get the autocorrelation function
